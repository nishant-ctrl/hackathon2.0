Hackathon 2024<br>
Hello, We're Team ClueLess Coders from National Institute of Technology Sikkim.<br> 
The Project that we've worked on is titled AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System.<br>
Introduction:<br>
This repository houses a comprehensive AI-driven system designed to<br> accurately predict crop diseases and provide effective management<br> strategies. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this<br> system offers farmers a valuable tool to mitigate crop losses and<br> enhance agricultural productivity.<br>

Key Features:<br>
Disease Prediction: Utilizes deep learning models to analyze visual data<br>(e.g., images of plant leaves) and accurately identify various crop diseases.<br>

Disease Management Recommendations:<br>
Provides tailored recommendations based on predicted diseases, including<br> 
appropriate treatments, preventive measures, and optimal timing<br>
for intervention.<br>

Data Analytics:<br>
Offers valuable insights into disease trends, helping farmers make informed<br>
decisions and optimize their agricultural practices.<br>

Technologies Used:<br>
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow<br>
Image Processing: OpenCV<br>
Data Management: SQL or NoSQL databases<br>
Web Application: Jupyter Notebook<br>
